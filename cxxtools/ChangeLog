  - replace std::string with char* as a buffer in udpstream-class
  - remove RWLOCK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER because this is unknown on Mac OS X and
    the rwlock_t-structure is anyway initalized with pthread_rwlock_init

  - make cxxtools::socket::doPoll-method public and rename to poll

2007-04-26 tommi@tntnet.org

2007-04-18 tommi@tntnet.org

    the c++-standard (now std::ios::init is used for initialization)

2007-04-11 tommi@tntnet.org
  - don't pass uninitialized std::streabuf to base-class in classes
    derived from std::[io]stream. This should be ok, but at least

  - replace semaphore with condition in cxxtools::Pool and make max-size
    of pool settable

    exception occurs during creation of log-message)
  - Condition::timedwait

2006-12-31 tommi@tntnet.org

    accidentally converting QueryParams-objects into const_iterator

2006-11-22 tommi@tntnet.org

  - make loggers more private and instantiate existing loggers later
  - "putchar" is a macro somewhere - rename member-method to workaround
    this name-conflict

2006-11-20 tommi@tntnet.org

  - fix tcpstream to correctly report end-of-file in all circumstances

2006-09-11 tommi@tntnet.org

  - new helper-class IConverter for easier usage of iconv(3) and iconvstream

2006-07-27 tommi@tntnet.org

  - fix iconvstream

2006-06-21 tommi@tntnet.org

  - license changed to LGPL

2006-05-24 tommi@tntnet.org

  - fix tcp-client: create socket when known, which to create
    this fixes also problems in running any applications on systems without
    IPv6

  - flushdelay works now with rolling-files
  - ANSI-C++-fixes

2006-03-02 tommi@tntnet.org

  - new logging-parameter flushdelay, which speeds up logging
    by starting a backgroundthread, which flushes asynchronous

2005-01-20 tommi@tntnet.org

  - thread-classes simplified and demo improved
  - output of log-messages speed-optimized

2005-12-12 tommi@tntnet.org

  - improved error-checking in network-classes
