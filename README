Cxxtools
========

cxxtools is my toolbox with reusable c++-components

see INSTALL for installation-instructions


Installation from GIT
=====================

In the GIT-repository there is no configure-script, but configure.ac,
which is the source for configure. You need autoconf and automake to
create configure. 

A quick start guide (for more details see INSTALL):

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
