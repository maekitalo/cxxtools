    /** @brief Run registered tests

        The application class serves as an environment for a number of tests
        to be run. An application object is usually created in the main loop
        of a program and the return value of Unit::Application::run returned.
        A reporter can be set for the application to process test events.
        Reporters can be made to print information to the console or write
        XML logs. A typical example may look like this:

        @code
            int main()
            {
                cxxtools::Unit::Reporter reporter;
                cxxtools::Unit::Application app;
                app.setReporter(reporter);
                return app.run();
            }
        @endcode

        The TestMain.h include already defines a main loop with an application
        for the common use case.
